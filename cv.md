## About me

_I am 26 years old. I am a lawyer, but I am currently on maternity leave. I was a little bit disappointed in my field, so I decided to change my profession. I've watched a lot of Youtube videos about IT specialties, in particular about Front-end developers. All this interested me. I really want to get skills which help me in the futute to find a lovely job. By the way, my husband inspired me with his example. He was studing by himself, and now successfully he is working as a programmer. Also I have a hobby. I knit toys in my free time._
